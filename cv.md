## About me
My name is Saba Ozbegashvili, 21 years old, **Full Stack web Developer**.
I love every single thing related to web development. Writing codes without losing my sanity.Today, I am working as a full stack web developer, but concurrently study a lot in order to be kept up with a new technologies and best practises, because as you know this is a fast developing field.

The most attractive for me are projects with biggest challenges, when the solution seems out of reach and the natural feeling is confusion, that you will never find the solution, but here is when all fun starts, it's place where you develope your research skills, critical thinking and the ways how to deal the stress and how not to lose hope in yourself.

I've very facility to make new friends and love to work and collaborate with teams. And nothing is better than to work with teams and share knowledge and experience for growing's sake.

I'm always studying new things, new technologies, and I never give up of study! After all, what we learning is the only capital what we never lose, nobody can take this of us!
